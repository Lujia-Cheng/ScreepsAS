# ScreepsAS

### *Screeps artificial stupidity*

## Intro

First thing first, I ain't no programmer nor recieved any systematic programming training. One Java intro cource in college, that's all I got.

So this code structure will be shitty, I'll tried to get it commentted as good as possible, hope to save you some headache.

## Structure and Design

The idea behind the code is super general. This game, screeps, is all about moving those so-called `resouces` around. For example, `energies` been *`harvested`* from `source`, *`dropped`* to `conatiners` and then transported into `extensions` or being used on `upgradeController`.

Therefore, creeps are merely "moving company". They take stuff (energies, minerals, etc)

## About creeps' military action

The fact is, no matter how smart an AI is, it'll always be dumber than the dumbest human, unless one can somehow write a deep-learning AI for his screeps (let me know if anyone made it. Like, for real, let me know). Therefore, this code only implement basic defenses but leave those big-brain operations to user.
