## General process

Home irettrate structures to generate tasks
look up which creep shall take such task,
assing tasks to free creeps,

# Exception (solution)

Creep die before task finished. (store creep's id in home task)
Task repeated. (store strucuture's id)
Old task, no creep's getting (spawn) corresond creep
